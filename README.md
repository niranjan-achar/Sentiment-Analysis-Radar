## 🧩 Concept Overview  

The **Sentiment Analysis Radar** integrates two complementary NLP techniques:  

- **Sentiment Analysis** → Goes beyond binary classification by providing polarity, emotional tone, and confidence scores.  
- **Machine Translation** → Accurately converts text between languages while preserving meaning, cultural nuances, and emotional undertones.  

⚡ The core challenge is ensuring **emotional fidelity** after translation, where subtle cues can be lost or altered.
